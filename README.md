# HarvardX-MovieLens-Project-Capstone

Online streaming services have known a tremendous success in the last years, strengthened in 2020 by the covid crisis. With the multiplication of sources and contents, movie / serie recommender systems has become a key element both for provider and users. Netflix, one of the leading provider of online streaming has even launched in 2006 a a challenge to the data science community: improve their recommendation algorithm by 10% and win a million dollars.

For this project, which is one of the 2 projects of the HarvardX: PH125.9x Data Science: Capstone course, we will create a movie recommendation system using the MovieLens dataset.

MovieLens is a research site run by GroupLens Research at the University of Minnesota. Based on users movie ratings, MovieLens uses “collaborative filtering” technology to generate personalized predictions for movies. MovieLens provides datasets of several sizes of their user ratings.
